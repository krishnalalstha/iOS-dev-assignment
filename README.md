### Assignment

Create a contact management application using [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) with a simple login using [Firbase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) that must include an email signup, along with atleast one Social Media platform of your choice. 

Your app should let users:
* Add/Edit new contact(location of user is compulsory), 
* List existing contacts,
* Show contact detail page,
* Show user location in the Map
* When showing detail. there should be a menu/option to show map with direction from your location to user location using [Google Direction API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/)
* Schedule a periodic check for any updates in the user's contact database.

Once contact information is loaded (both listing and detail) data should persist. Any persistance mechnism can be used, i.e., cache or database.

Design as you wish, keeping material design principles in mind.
